  <h2>Wonderful musician, easy to work with</h2>
  <p>Jordan has played at several of our donor family events over the past few years. These events are for families who have lost loved ones, sometimes very recently so they are very emotional events. We continue to ask Jordan to play because 1) He
    plays beautifully and we love his music, 2) He is always professional and shows up on time and plays for as long as he has agreed to and sometimes longer, 3) He has such empathy for people and it shows in his presence and his music, 4) He is
    ethical. He couldn't make it to an event because we had to reschedule due to bad weather. He had already been paid and we wanted him to keep the money because it was not his fault that the weather didn't cooperate. He insisted that he not be paid
    for the next event. Finally, he is just an all-around nice guy and so easy to work with.</p>

  <h2>Choose Jordan - You Won't Be Disappointed!</h2>
  <p>Jordan did our ceremony music and cocktail hour and we were so impressed! On our first interactions, Jordan was responsive, collaborative, professional, personable, and matched the vibe we were going for (easy going and contemporary). Through
    the process Jordan gave us recommendations for songs that really made our ceremony feel like ours. Day of, he arrived really early to set up and make sure everything went smoothly. He provided all the necessary equipment including mics. For our
    cocktail hour, he played a mix of instrumental and covers - he's a really great singer and great on guitar! He did a great job prepping the songs he knew we would like and gave the cocktail hour a really great vibe. We're so thankful we were able
    to snag Jordan and have him set the tone for our ceremony and cocktail hour. Do yourself (and your guests!) a favor and book Jordan!!</p>

  <h2>He made our ceremony and cocktail hour truly special</h2>
  <p>What can I say about Jordan. Well first of all, he was so easy to talk and so accommodating. He’s so skilled at what he does. Not only are his acoustic guitar skills amazing but so is his voice! We had Jordan sing our first dance and it was
    amazing. Truly Something my husband and I will never forget. We highly recommended Jordan! </p>
