  <h2>Amazing guitar player and stress-free planning!</h2>
  <p>Working with Jordan was one of the easiest parts of planning our wedding. He helped us decide what pre-ceremony and ceremony music we wanted, learned 2 new songs we selected, and was a true professional throughout the process. He arrived early
    on the wedding day and was all set up and playing without us needing to coordinate anything! On top of that, he's extremely talented and has a wonderful finger-picking style. If you're looking for a guitar player to provide beautiful,
    personalized music and a stress-free planning process - hire Jordan! </p>

  <h2>Incredible Music</h2>
  <p>Jordan performed Acoustic/vocal music for our daughter’s wedding day June, 2019 at The Homestead. He performed the solo of In My Life for the ceremony, and honestly, it was the most beautiful version I have ever heard. He also performed an hour
    of music for the cocktail hour and our guests really enjoyed his music. The Cocktail Hour location had to be changed to inside because of rain and he was quick to adapt to the change in location. He was also quick to respond to emails and phone
    calls and was so helpful during the wedding planning process. I highly recommend Jordan for any wedding music choice, but honestly, I recommend him for any acoustic music entertainment as he is so incredibly talented. Choose him for your special
    day....you will certainly be glad that you did! </p>

  <p>If you need an acoustic musician, look no further! Jordan flawlessly executed our ceremony and cocktail music--I could not have asked for a more flexible and talented musician. Between my husband and I, we have some very opposing music styles;
    however, with Jordan's patience, creativity and flexibility, we were able to come up with a blended ceremony lineup that perfectly matched our tastes</p>

  <p>Jordan was such a breath of fresh air to work with in planning our ceremony music. He made helpful suggestions on song choices and catered to all our special request songs. Jordan even went the extra mile to coordinate directly with the wedding
    planner to ensure our planning process was as stress-free as possible. We highly recommend Jordan McLamb Music!!</p>
